## Functional requirements

The company wants to invest in owning its infrastructure, as there is a concern about the privacy of user data. Also, there is a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will significantly rise.

They want to invest in an AI PC that can afford to spend 10-15k. 

They have 400 active students, and students are located within the city of Manchester.

## Assumptions

We assume that the open-source LLMs we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.

We will hook up a single server in our office to the Internet, and we should have enough capacity to serve 400 students.


## Data Strategy

There is a concern about copyrighted materials. For that reason, we have to purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it's an open-source model with traceable training data. This allows us to avoid copyright issues and understand what is happening in the model.
