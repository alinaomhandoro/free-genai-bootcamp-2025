To build the API backend for the language learning app portal, I plan to create the following components based on the provided specifications:

1. **Directory Structure**: Set up the directory structure as outlined, ensuring that each directory serves its intended purpose.
2. **HTTP Handlers**: In the `internal/handlers` directory, I will create separate handler files for different features such as dashboard, words, and groups. Each handler will manage the incoming requests and responses for the respective API endpoints.
3. **Business Logic**: In the `internal/service` directory, I will implement the business logic that interacts with the models and processes data as required by the handlers.
4. **Models**: Define data structures and database operations in the `internal/models` directory to manage vocabulary words, groups, study sessions, and review items.
5. **Database Setup**: Create migration files in the `db/migrations` directory to set up the database schema and seed files in the `db/seeds` directory to populate the database with initial data.
6. **Task Runner**: Define tasks in the `magefile.go` for initializing the database, running migrations, and seeding data.
7. **Module Definition**: Specify the module and its dependencies in the `go.mod` file.
8. **Documentation**: Provide setup instructions and API usage in the `README.md`.

Once we agree on this structure, I can proceed to create the necessary files and their contents. 

Shall I go ahead and generate the contents for the `internal/handlers` and `internal/service` directories?
