To populate the `/backend_go/db/seeds` directory with initial data for the language learning application, I will create a JSON seed file that includes vocabulary words along with their corresponding translations and group associations. This will help in setting up the database with meaningful data for testing and development.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the contents I plan to include in the seed file:

1. **Vocabulary Words**: Each entry will have the following fields:
   - `kanji`: The Japanese character representation of the word.
   - `romaji`: The Romanized version of the word.
   - `english`: The English translation of the word.
   - `group_id`: The ID of the group to which the word belongs.

2. **Example Entries**: I will include a few example vocabulary words to demonstrate the structure.

Once you confirm this plan, I will proceed to generate the contents for the seed file.
